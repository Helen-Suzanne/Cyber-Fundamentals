## OWASP TOP 10 Vulnerabilities 

## What Is OWASP?

OWASP, or the Open Web Application Security Project, is a nonprofit organization focused on software security. Their projects include a number of open-source software development programs and toolkits, local chapters and conferences, among other things. One of their projects is the maintenance of the OWASP Top 10, a list of the top 10 security risks faced by web applications.

### OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the 10 most common web application security risks. By writing code and performing robust testing with these risks in mind, developers can create secure applications that keep their users’ confidential data safe from attackers.

# 1. Injection
Injection occurs when an attacker exploits insecure code to insert (or inject) their own code into a program. Because the program is unable to determine code inserted in this way from its own code, attackers are able to use injection attacks to access secure areas and confidential information as though they are trusted users. Examples of injection include SQL injections, command injections, CRLF injections, and LDAP injections.
Application security testing can reveal injection flaws and suggest remediation techniques such as stripping special characters from user input or writing parameterized SQL queries.

# Broken Authentication
Incorrectly implemented authentication and session management calls can be a huge security risk. If attackers notice these vulnerabilities, they may be able to easily assume legitimate users' identities.
Multifactor authentication is one way to mitigate broken authentication. Implement DAST and SCA scans to detect and remove issues with implementation errors before code is deployed.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Helen-Suzanne/Cyber-Fundamentals/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
